# Amiga500 single power

This is a DCDC converter Module to fit in Rev. 6a+ Amiga 500 mainboards.
It will be soldered onto the mainboard and one can then use a 12V barrel jack power supply with the Amiga 500.

It can deliver upto 6A @ 5V and 500mA @ -12V. The 12V line is passed through.

It also adds a power switch to the machine on the backside.

It has been tested by me and was found to be working good.
